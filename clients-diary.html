    <p>I’ve known Mansi since school days. She was always creative and hard working. But it was amazing to see how she has continued with her passion in her profession. A team of highly skilled professional and creative individuals. Mansi understood what I was looking for in the decor, took it 10 notches up and delivered the dream theme. The mehndi decor was done keeping in mind with our dress code - phulkari (traditional punjabi embroidery technique) and it was BANG ON !!! Everyone loved the handicrafts, mehndi stations, Photo booth. The most astounding thing about Mansi is that she never settles for anything less than perfect and its clearly visible in her work. Thank you for the amazing experience Artwaale. Keep rocking !!! </p>

    <p> For me, working with Mansi di and her team was an absolute enthralling experience. It was for the very first time that we opted for the event designer. Having said that, I am thankful to Mansi di as we sticked to her vision and believed that even within the restricted budget she can do wonders. And without any doubt I can say, her efforts paid off well. Extremely Impressed by the innovative ideas that were incorporated and executed in an exceptional manner.. Thanks again!</p>

    <p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  <br>
What should I tell about Mansi and her husband. I can just say that my mehendi function couldn't have been better ! And all thanks to her and her team.. final outcome I got was surely more than my expectations...What shook me is Mansi's dedication towards perfection...I told her my budget (it wasn’t that High)...But she made sure that she provided the best outcome in that budget...she was open to listen to my ideas as well and adapted to my choices...She is flexible and is ok with last minute changes as well...She understood that this function was imp for me... She and her husband ensured that everything is perfect and that is why they came one day before the function to see the place, to get comfortable with my family members and she was there bang on early Morning at my place..Sharp on rather before time...Her continuous hard work of 5-6 hours came out extremely beautiful and all my friends and relatives simply LOVED THE OVERALL DECOR!! Moreover, when she got to know it was my b’day that day, she specially went out and got me a super cool gift! She is perpetually booked for all my n my family's future functions...Can't work with anybody else after working with her ...And trust me I don't know her personally, so this review comes as a genuine review of her services ....HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !
